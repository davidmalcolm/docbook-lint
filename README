docbook-lint is a tool to check DocBook XML files for various problems.

So far it checks for the following:
- overly long lines within <screen> elements
- overly long content within <computeroutput> elements
- spelling mistakes
- presence of "forbidden" words (e.g. for swearwords or trademarks); this needs
to be configured

See TODO for ideas for other features, and HACKING for development info.

It doesn't implement DTD validation at the moment; there are plenty of other
tools for doing that (although a patch would be welcome)
